# API Documentation Enhancement Principles

## Core Principle: Enhance, Don't Replace

When improving API documentation, we must:

### 1. **Review Existing Documentation First**
- Read and understand what's already documented
- Identify what works well in the current documentation
- Preserve valuable explanations and workflows

### 2. **Identify What's Missing**
- Technical details (validation rules, formats)
- Examples (request/response)
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases
- Performance considerations

### 3. **Build Upon Existing Content**
- Keep the original narrative flow
- Add technical details as supplements
- Maintain the clarity of purpose
- Enhance rather than rewrite

## Example: Tracking Requests Endpoint

### ❌ Wrong Approach (What I Did Initially)
```
Original: "To track an ocean shipment, you create a new tracking request..."
Replaced with: "Create a new tracking request to start monitoring a container..."
```
- Lost the workflow explanation
- Removed webhook notification details
- Focused only on technical validation

### ✅ Correct Approach
```
Original: "To track an ocean shipment, you create a new tracking request..."
Enhanced: [Keep original] + Add sections for:
  - Request Types
  - Validation Rules  
  - Processing Flow
  - Examples
```

## Enhancement Checklist

For each endpoint:

1. [ ] Read existing documentation completely
2. [ ] List what's good about current docs
3. [ ] Identify gaps and missing information
4. [ ] Create enhancement plan that preserves good content
5. [ ] Add new sections that complement existing docs
6. [ ] Ensure the flow still makes sense
7. [ ] Verify technical accuracy
8. [ ] Test that examples work

## Documentation Quality Metrics

Good documentation should:
- **Tell a story** - Explain the workflow/process
- **Be purposeful** - Why would someone use this?
- **Be complete** - Include all necessary details
- **Be practical** - Provide working examples
- **Be scannable** - Use headers and formatting

## Common Enhancement Patterns

### 1. Workflow Preservation
```markdown
[Original workflow explanation]

## Technical Details
[New validation rules, formats, etc.]
```

### 2. Example Addition
```markdown
[Original description]

## Examples
### Example 1: [Common Use Case]
[Request/Response]

### Example 2: [Edge Case]
[Request/Response]
```

### 3. Error Documentation
```markdown
[Original success flow]

## Error Handling
When requests fail, you'll receive...
[Error examples and solutions]
```

## Remember

The best documentation:
- Helps users understand the "why" and "how"
- Provides technical details when needed
- Shows real examples
- Explains what happens (workflow)
- Anticipates common questions

Always ask: "Am I making this better or just different?"
