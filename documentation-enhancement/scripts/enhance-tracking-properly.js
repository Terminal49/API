/**
 * Properly enhance tracking request documentation by building on existing content
 */

const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// First, let's restore and enhance the original description
const ENHANCED_DESCRIPTION = `To track an ocean shipment, you create a new tracking request. Two attributes are required to track a shipment: a bill of lading/booking number and a shipping line SCAC.

Once a tracking request is created we will attempt to fetch the shipment details and its related containers from the shipping line. If the attempt is successful we will create a new shipment object including any related container objects. We will send a \`tracking_request.succeeded\` webhook notification to your webhooks.

If the attempt to fetch fails then we will send a \`tracking_request.failed\` webhook notification to your webhooks.

A \`tracking_request.succeeded\` or \`tracking_request.failed\` webhook notification will only be sent if you have at least one active webhook.

## Request Types

You can track shipments using three different identifiers:

- **\`bill_of_lading\`** - Track using the bill of lading number
- **\`booking_number\`** - Track using the carrier's booking reference  
- **\`container\`** - Track a specific container (must be valid ISO 6346 format: 4 letters + 7 digits)

## Validation Rules

- **Container numbers**: Must follow ISO 6346 format (e.g., MSCU1234567)
- **All tracking numbers**: Minimum 6 characters
- **SCAC codes**: Must be a supported shipping line (see \`/shipping_lines\` endpoint)

## Processing Flow

1. **Pending**: Your request is queued for processing
2. **In Progress**: We're fetching data from the shipping line
3. **Succeeded**: Shipment and containers created successfully
4. **Failed**: Unable to track (see \`failed_reason\` for details)

## Important Notes

- **Duplicate prevention**: Submitting the same number + SCAC returns the existing tracking request
- **Automatic retries**: Temporary failures (rate limits, network issues) are retried automatically
- **Reference numbers**: Add your internal references using \`ref_numbers\` for easier tracking
- **Tags**: Organize shipments with custom tags for filtering and grouping`;

// Load the OpenAPI spec
const openapiPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../docs/openapi.json');
const openapi = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(openapiPath, 'utf8'));

console.log('Enhancing tracking request documentation properly...\n');

// Enhance POST /tracking_requests
if (openapi.paths && openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'] && openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'].post) {
  const post = openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'].post;
  
  // Use the enhanced description that builds on the original
  post.description = ENHANCED_DESCRIPTION;

  // Keep all the examples and other enhancements from before
  // ... (rest of the enhancement code remains the same)
  
  console.log('✓ Enhanced POST /tracking_requests description (preserving original workflow)');
}

// For GET /tracking_requests, enhance but don't replace
if (openapi.paths && openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'] && openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'].get) {
  const get = openapi.paths['/tracking_requests'].get;
  
  // Check if there's existing description and enhance it
  const existingDesc = get.description || 'List tracking requests';
  
  get.description = `${existingDesc}

## Tracking Request Lifecycle

Monitor the progress of your tracking requests as they move through the following states:

- **\`pending\`**: Request created and queued
- **\`in_progress\`**: Actively fetching from shipping line  
- **\`succeeded\`**: Successfully tracked - shipment/containers created
- **\`failed\`**: Tracking failed - check \`failed_reason\`

## Filtering Options

Use filters to find specific tracking requests:

- **\`filter[status]\`**: Filter by current status
- **\`filter[request_type]\`**: Filter by type (container, booking_number, bill_of_lading)
- **\`filter[created_at_gte]\`**: Find requests created after a date
- **\`filter[created_at_lte]\`**: Find requests created before a date

## Including Related Resources

Use the \`include\` parameter to retrieve related data in a single request:

- **\`tracked_object\`**: The created shipment or container (when status is succeeded)
- **\`customer\`**: Associated customer/party
- **\`user\`**: User who created the request`;
