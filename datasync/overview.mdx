Terminal49 DataSync is the easiest way to get fresh, up-to-date container and shipment data into your system.

DataSync will create three tables in your system, in the schema/dataset/folder/spreadsheet of your choice: [containers](/datasync/table-properties/containers_rail), [shipments](/datasync/table-properties/shipments), and [tracking_requests](/datasync/table-properties/tracking-requests). In addition to these three tables, a technical table named [_transfer_status](/datasync/table-properties/transfer-status) is created, which tells you when each table was last refreshed.

We can send the data to almost any database, data warehouse, or object store, as well as to Google Sheets. See the [full list of supported systems](/datasync/supported-destinations).


## How often does the data update?
DataSync refreshes the data tables every hour.

Each refresh reloads only the rows that have changed since the previous refresh, minimizing unnecessary writes to your system.

To check when a table was last updated, check the [_transfer_status](/datasync/table-properties/transfer-status) table. For each row in that table, there is a unique table key and the time when the latest sync occurred for that table.


## How to use the data
You can use the container and shipment tracking data in many ways. Here are some common use cases:

    - Send data directly to your visualization/analytics/reports software like Power BI or Tableau
    - Send data directly to your TMS or ERP system
    - Join data with one of your existing tables
    - Use a Database View or Pivot Table to narrow down what you're looking at or rename columns
    - Use Database Triggers to respond to updates


## The setup process
For users already tracking shipments with Terminal49, the setup is a three-step process that typically takes less than two hours. Some simpler setups can be completed in as little as 20 minutes.

    1. **Connect data systems**: This step may involve role-based authentication or sharing credentials for a single-purpose user. See our [security FAQ](https://help.terminal49.com/en/articles/7988732-security-considerations-for-terminal49-datasync) to learn how we keep your data secure.
    
    2. **One-hour configuration call**: We ensure your data is configured properly to fit with your existing data structure and requirements.
    
    3. **Start querying the data**: You're ready to go! There's nothing new to learn - simply use the tools you already know with your enhanced dataset.
