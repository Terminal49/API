  - Add best practices for error handling and retry logic

- [ ] **Step 8: Refine Documentation Structure and Navigation**
  - Reorganize content for intuitive flow
  - Add cross-references between related sections
  - Improve search functionality and discoverability
  - Ensure consistent formatting and terminology throughout

- [ ] **Step 9: Implement Feedback Mechanisms**
  - Add visible feedback options on each documentation page
  - Create issue templates for documentation problems
  - Establish process for handling documentation feedback
  - Add community contribution guidelines

- [ ] **Step 10: Regular Review and Updates**
  - Schedule regular documentation audits
  - Establish process for updating docs with API changes
  - Create documentation testing procedures
  - Implement analytics to identify most-used and problematic sections

## Current Status: Step 2 & 3 In Progress

### Step 1 Completed: Documentation Audit and Gap Analysis
After a thorough review of the documentation, we identified several key improvement areas:

1. **Structure**:
   - Current sections: getting-started, in-depth-guides, useful-info, api-reference
   - Documentation uses MDX format with a mint.json configuration
   - OpenAPI spec is used for endpoint documentation (openapi.json file)

2. **Endpoint Documentation**:
   - API references are organized by resource type
   - Found endpoints for: webhooks, tracking-requests, vessels, shipping-lines, terminals, ports, shipments, containers, metro-areas, parties
   - Most endpoint docs are minimal, using just the OpenAPI spec without additional explanations or examples
   - Real-world example responses are limited, especially showing different states of resources

3. **Onboarding Flow**:
   - Current getting-started section has 4 pages: start-here, tracking-shipments-and-containers, list-shipments-and-containers, receive-status-updates
   - Webhook implementation is mentioned but not emphasized in the initial flow
   - Test numbers exist but are located in useful-info section rather than integrated directly into onboarding
   - No clear guidance on checking webhook delivery or troubleshooting setup issues

4. **Advanced Topics**:
   - Tracking request lifecycle documentation exists but lacks visual workflow diagram
   - Webhook documentation is extensive but separated from the initial onboarding flow
   - No clear industry-specific implementation guides
   - Limited tutorials for building common integrations

5. **Identified Gaps**:
   - Need for comprehensive examples showing different resource states (e.g., container in transit vs. with customs hold)
   - Webhook implementation should be emphasized earlier and more strongly in the onboarding flow
   - Test numbers should be integrated into onboarding process rather than hidden in useful-info
   - No FAQ or troubleshooting section for common integration issues
   - Limited industry-specific guides explaining the business value and implementation patterns
   - Incomplete error documentation for API endpoints
   - Missing "Capabilities Overview" page to highlight API features for non-developers

### Steps 2 & 3 Progress Update

#### Completed Files:
1. **Getting Started Improvements**:
   - ✅ `/docs/api-docs/getting-started/start-here.mdx` - Enhanced with clear introduction and better organization
   - ✅ `/docs/api-docs/getting-started/capabilities-overview.mdx` - Created comprehensive overview of API capabilities

2. **In-Depth Guides Improvements**:
   - ✅ `/docs/api-docs/in-depth-guides/json-api-guide.mdx` - Added detailed guide on JSON:API concepts

3. **API Reference Improvements**:
   - ✅ `/docs/api-docs/api-reference/tracking-requests/create-a-tracking-request.mdx` - Enhanced with comprehensive examples and troubleshooting

#### Next Files to Update:
1. **Getting Started Improvements**:
   - [ ] `/docs/api-docs/in-depth-guides/quickstart.mdx` - Revise to emphasize webhook setup earlier

2. **API Reference Improvements**:
   - [ ] `/docs/api-docs/api-reference/webhooks/create-a-webhook.mdx` - Enhance with detailed examples
   - [ ] `/docs/api-docs/api-reference/containers/get-a-container.mdx` - Add examples showing different states

3. **New Content to Create**:
   - [ ] `/docs/api-docs/in-depth-guides/polling-vs-webhooks.mdx` - Create new guide explaining both approaches
   - [ ] `/docs/api-docs/troubleshooting/common-issues.mdx` - Create FAQ and troubleshooting section

## Prioritized Improvement Plan

Based on the audit, here's our prioritized list of improvements:

1. **High Priority**:
   - Add comprehensive request/response examples for each endpoint showing different states
   - Create a capabilities overview page highlighting key API features
   - Improve quick start guide with early webhook integration and test numbers
   - Add a FAQ and troubleshooting section

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Develop practical tutorials for common use cases
   - Create industry-specific implementation guides
   - Add error handling best practices

3. **Lower Priority**:
   - Refine documentation structure and navigation
   - Implement feedback mechanisms
   - Establish regular review process

## Next Steps for Step 1:
1. Complete detailed review of each endpoint's documentation
2. Create a template for enhanced endpoint documentation with examples
3. Draft a capabilities overview page outline
4. Design improved onboarding flow that emphasizes webhooks and test numbers
