## Notes on Implementation

Our approach focuses on:
1. Ensuring consistent format and style across all documentation
2. Adding practical examples that demonstrate real-world usage
3. Improving navigability to help users find relevant information quickly
4. Following JSON:API specification accurately in our examples
5. Providing clear guidance on webhooks vs. polling approaches

All documentation is being developed to align with OpenAPI specifications and Mintlify standards to ensure compatibility with the documentation portal.
