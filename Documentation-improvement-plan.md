Step 1: Conduct a Documentation Audit

What to do:
	1.	Review all existing pages – Identify incomplete or unclear endpoint references, broken links, missing parameters, or unaddressed error responses.
	2.	Gather feedback or known user issues – Collect any existing support tickets, GitHub issues, or user comments about the docs.
	3.	Compile a gap report – List each endpoint or topic where information is missing or unclear.

Why this step matters:
	•	Ensures we have a complete view of what’s working and what needs improvement.
	•	Prevents duplicating content or missing critical fixes.

Example content addition:
	•	“We found that the GET /containers documentation has no example for a container with a customs hold. We also discovered the ‘Webhook Retries’ page references an old link. We’ll address both.”

⸻

Step 2: Update and Expand Endpoint Documentation

What to do:
	1.	Add multi-scenario examples – Show how each endpoint behaves under different conditions (e.g., container delayed, container cleared, container picked up).
	2.	Provide request and response pairs – For each endpoint, include at least one full request body and the corresponding JSON response.
	3.	Explain key fields in plain language – Add short, friendly definitions (e.g., “last_free_day = The final date to pick up the container without incurring storage fees”).
	4.	Document all HTTP status codes – Include typical success (200/201) responses, as well as error codes (e.g., 400, 422, 500).

Why this step matters:
	•	Saves developers and non-developers time by showing them exactly what data to expect.
	•	Reduces guesswork about how the API handles edge cases.

Example content addition:

### GET /containers/:id

**Purpose:** Retrieve details of a specific container.

**Example Request:**
```bash
GET /containers/ABC123
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>

Example Response (Container with Customs Hold):

{
  "data": {
    "id": "ABC123",
    "type": "container",
    "attributes": {
      "status": "on_hold",
      "hold_reason": "Customs Inspection",
      "last_free_day": "2025-03-25",
      "pickup_location": "Port of Oakland Terminal 3",
      ...
    }
  }
}

Notes:
	•	status can be in_transit, arrived, on_hold, or picked_up.
	•	hold_reason is returned only if status is on_hold.
	•	last_free_day indicates the last day to avoid demurrage charges.

## Step 3: Create a “Capabilities Overview” Page

**What to do:**
1. **Summarize Terminal49’s functionality** – Provide a high-level, non-technical description of major features (tracking ocean shipments, retrieving events, data standardization).
2. **Highlight key endpoints** – Offer a quick link or table referencing the main endpoints (e.g., Tracking Requests, Containers, Shipping Lines).
3. **Explain benefits in business terms** – Emphasize how this data helps reduce manual tracking, avoid fees, and automate notifications.

**Why this step matters:**
- Non-developers (like operations managers) can understand the scope of what Terminal49 offers.
- Helps new users grasp the bigger picture before diving into endpoint specifics.

**Example content addition:**
```markdown
# Capabilities Overview

Terminal49’s API provides end-to-end container tracking and logistics data. Key capabilities include:

- **Real-Time Event Notifications**: Get alerted on arrivals, holds, vessel departures, and more.
- **Automated Updates**: Standardized data from multiple carriers, terminals, and rail lines.
- **Reference Data**: Access shipping lines, ports, and terminal information without manual lookups.

**Why It Matters**
- **Reduce Manual Work**: Eliminate the need for manual carrier websites and phone calls.
- **Prevent Extra Fees**: Track Last Free Day changes in real time to avoid demurrage charges.
- **Improve Visibility**: Combine container statuses from multiple carriers in one place.

Step 4: Develop a “Quick Start” Onboarding Guide

What to do:
	1.	Focus on event-driven architecture – Introduce webhooks early, explaining how to register them and why they are more efficient than polling.
	2.	Show a minimal end-to-end example – Include code for creating a Tracking Request, receiving a webhook event, and verifying the data.
	3.	Provide test numbers – Show how to simulate a real workflow with test SCAC or container IDs.

Why this step matters:
	•	Gives beginners a fast path to seeing how data flows from Terminal49 to their system.
	•	Encourages best practices (i.e., webhooks) from the start.

Example content addition:

# Quick Start Guide

## 1. Get Your API Key
Sign up on Terminal49, navigate to your account settings, and copy your `API_KEY`.

## 2. Create Your First Tracking Request
Send a POST request to `/tracking_requests`:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.terminal49.com/tracking_requests \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "tracking_request",
      "attributes": {
        "scac": "TEST",
        "container_number": "TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED"
      }
    }
  }'

This will initiate a track-and-trace request. Using "TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED" ensures a successful mock response.

3. Set Up a Webhook

Register your webhook endpoint:

curl -X POST https://api.terminal49.com/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "data": {
      "type": "webhook",
      "attributes": {
        "url": "https://yourdomain.com/t49-webhook",
        "event_types": ["tracking_request.succeeded", "container.arrived"]
      }
    }
  }'

4. Verify the Webhook Event

You will receive a JSON POST at https://yourdomain.com/t49-webhook once the container status updates. Now you’re all set!

---

## Step 5: Add a “Polling vs. Webhooks” Section

**What to do:**
1. **Explain both approaches** – Show how to set up a periodic poll, then highlight the advantages of webhooks (lower overhead, real-time updates).
2. **Discuss trade-offs** – Provide examples of when polling might be acceptable (simple prototypes, no real-time requirement).

**Why this step matters:**
- Clarifies best practice for new integrators.
- Reduces confusion about which model to implement for production systems.

**Example content addition:**
```markdown
# Polling vs. Webhooks

## Polling
- **How It Works**: Your system calls Terminal49’s API at regular intervals for updates.
- **Pros**: Simple to implement initially.
- **Cons**: Risk of missing urgent events, higher API usage, potential rate-limit issues.

## Webhooks
- **How It Works**: Terminal49 sends updates to your registered endpoint in real time.
- **Pros**: Reduced overhead, immediate notifications, best for large-scale or time-sensitive operations.
- **Cons**: Requires setting up and maintaining a secure, publicly accessible endpoint.

Step 6: Create Tutorials (Hands-On Guides)

What to do:
	1.	Implement short, focused tutorials – E.g., Building a “Where’s My Container?” Dashboard, Sending Delay Alerts via Email, etc.
	2.	Show code in common languages – Provide examples in Python, Node.js, or another popular stack.
	3.	Add screenshots or diagrams – Visuals help non-technical team members and managers follow along.

Why this step matters:
	•	Offers real-world use cases that demonstrate how to stitch endpoints together.
	•	Helps new users quickly build something tangible.

Example content addition:

# Tutorial: Building a “Where’s My Container?” Dashboard

In this tutorial, you’ll:
1. Create tracking requests.
2. Fetch container statuses.
3. Display status updates on a simple web page.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- Basic HTML knowledge

...

## Step 3: Fetch Container Status
Use this endpoint in your Node.js backend:
```js
const axios = require('axios');

async function getContainer(containerId, apiKey) {
  const resp = await axios.get(
    `https://api.terminal49.com/containers/${containerId}`,
    { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` } }
  );
  return resp.data;
}

…

## Step 7: Add Industry-Specific Guides

**What to do:**
1. **Create pages targeting different verticals** – Freight forwarders, importers, 3PLs, trucking companies, etc.
2. **Highlight relevant endpoints or workflows** – E.g., *How a freight forwarder can bulk-track multiple containers*, *How drayage companies use `last_free_day` to optimize pickups*.
3. **Use minimal code, more workflow diagrams** – Because these guides often serve operations managers or non-developers.

**Why this step matters:**
- Demonstrates how to leverage the API’s features for specific business goals.
- Bridges the knowledge gap for less technical readers.

**Example content addition:**
```markdown
# Terminal49 for Freight Forwarders

**Common Use Cases**:
- Consolidate multiple container statuses in your TMS.
- Track containers across different carriers and terminals.

**Key Endpoints**:
- `POST /tracking_requests`: Bulk create tracking for many containers at once.
- `GET /containers`: Retrieve statuses of all active shipments.

**Recommended Workflow**:
1. Import your container list into Terminal49 via `/tracking_requests`.
2. Receive real-time updates through your custom webhook.
3. Surface any exceptions (e.g., holds, delays) in your TMS or an internal dashboard.

Step 8: Introduce FAQ & Troubleshooting Pages

What to do:
	1.	Aggregate common questions – E.g., “Why is my container not updating?”, “How do I handle a 422 error?”
	2.	Provide immediate answers – Link to relevant documentation sections if needed.
	3.	Encourage user contributions – Let users submit new questions or solutions via GitHub issues or support emails.

Why this step matters:
	•	Reduces repetitive support queries.
	•	Offers quick fixes for frequent integration issues.

Example content addition:

# FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: Why is my container not updating in real-time?
**A:** Make sure you have a webhook registered. Polling for updates might cause delays. See the [Polling vs. Webhooks](/docs/polling-vs-webhooks) page.

### Q: I received a 422 error when creating a tracking request. What does this mean?
**A:** Typically, this indicates a duplicate request or invalid container number. Double-check the container ID and SCAC. See [Tracking Request Errors](/docs/tracking-requests#errors).

Step 9: Refine Structure & Navigation

What to do:
	1.	Group related content – Ensure “Getting Started,” “API Reference,” “Tutorials,” “Guides,” and “FAQ” each have intuitive sections.
	2.	Add clear top-level navigation – For example:
	•	Overview
	•	Getting Started (Quick Start + Webhook Setup + FAQ)
	•	Reference (Endpoints)
	•	Tutorials
	•	Use Case Guides
	3.	Cross-link – Insert “See also” links in relevant pages to unify the documentation.

Why this step matters:
	•	Streamlines the user journey so they can quickly find relevant material.
	•	Encourages discovery of advanced features or best practices.

Example content addition:
	•	“At the end of the Quick Start Guide, add a link: ‘Want to learn more? Check out our Building an Alert System tutorial.’”

⸻

Step 10: Gather Feedback & Iterate

What to do:
	1.	Solicit user input – Encourage readers to open GitHub issues or submit feedback forms.
	2.	Monitor analytics – Track page views, time on page, and popular search terms to see if users find what they need.
	3.	Make incremental improvements – Update docs regularly based on feedback, new features, or changes in the API.

Why this step matters:
	•	Keeps the documentation “alive” and responsive to user needs.
	•	Avoids stagnation as the API evolves or new best practices emerge.

Example content addition:
	•	“Add a footer note: ‘Have questions or suggestions? Submit feedback here.’”
