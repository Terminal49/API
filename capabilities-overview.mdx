# Terminal49 API Capabilities

Terminal49's API provides end-to-end ocean freight visibility through a collection of endpoints that deliver real-time tracking data, reference information, and event notifications. This overview will help you understand what's possible and how each feature fits into your logistics workflows.

## Core Capabilities

## End-to-End Visibility

Terminal49 provides visibility across the entire container journey:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Origin Events">
    Track empty container pickup, loading, and departure from origin port.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ocean Transit">
    Follow vessel movements and receive ETA updates throughout the journey.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Port Arrival">
    Get notified when the vessel arrives, berths, and when containers are discharged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Terminal Status">
    Monitor container availability, customs status, holds, and last free day information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inland Movement">
    Track rail departures, arrivals, and final delivery events to inland destinations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Differentiators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Normalized Data Across Carriers">
    Terminal49 standardizes data from different carriers into a single consistent format. For example, each carrier might report a container discharge event differently, but Terminal49 normalizes these into the same event type (`container.transport.vessel_discharged`) with standardized timestamps and location formats.

    **Business Benefit**: Build once, track across all carriers without custom integration for each shipping line.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real-Time Events via Webhooks">
    Instead of constantly polling for updates, Terminal49 notifies you via webhooks when meaningful events occur. This includes status changes, ETA updates, terminal holds, and changes to last free day.

    **Business Benefit**: Respond immediately to delays, holds, or availability changes, reducing demurrage costs and improving planning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Last Free Day Tracking">
    Terminal49 actively monitors and notifies you of changes to Last Free Day (LFD) - the date by which containers must be picked up to avoid storage fees. This data is often buried in terminal websites and subject to change.

    **Business Benefit**: Avoid costly demurrage fees by prioritizing pickups based on accurate LFD information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Detailed Exception Data">
    The API provides comprehensive information about holds (customs, freight, terminal) and other exceptions that may delay pickup.

    **Business Benefit**: Proactively address holds and plan alternative shipments when delays occur.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Submit tracking requests** using bill of lading, booking, or container numbers
2. **Terminal49 monitors** these shipments by aggregating data from multiple sources
3. **Your systems receive updates** through webhooks when any change occurs
4. **Query additional information** as needed using the REST API endpoints
