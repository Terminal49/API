We offer two fantastic ways to track your shipments from origin to destination.

    1. [Terminal49 DataSync](/datasync/overview). Get tables full of fresh information delivered into your current data system. Easy to set up, and perfect for complementing your current data.
    2. [Terminal49 API](/api-docs/getting-started/start-here). Connect directly with the API, pull data for specific shipments and containers, and get updates via webhooks.

If you already have a data store that feeds the rest of your system, DataSync is probably what you want.

## What can I use Terminal49 data for?

Here are just a few of the data points we return and possible use-cases.

| Last Free Day and terminal status¹     | Track containers approaching LFD and prioritize dispatching              |
| Fees and holds at destination terminal | Clear your cargo to keep you containers moving                           |

## How it works

All you need to provide are your BOL numbers and SCACs. Terminal 49 will lookup the shipment with the carrier and populate shipment details including containers.

<Tip>
  **Don't know your SCAC?** Our [Auto-Detect
  Carrier](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/auto-detect-carrier) API can identify it
  automatically from your tracking number.
</Tip>

Once the shipment is set up, Terminal 49 periodically checks with the carrier and the destination terminal.

If any of the details of your shipment or containers change (for example - if the ETA changes) we'll ensure you're always kept up to date.

    - If you're using DataSync, we'll update the data in your system
    - If you're using the API, we'll post the shipment to the the webhook you provide
