title: Pagination
---

List methods accept pagination options with `page` and `pageSize`.

```ts
const shipments = await client.shipments.list(
  { updatedAfter: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' },
  { page: 1, pageSize: 25 }
);
```

The API response includes `links` and `meta` for paging. Use those to drive UI pagination or background sync.
