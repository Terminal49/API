This walkthrough covers a simple flow:

1. Track a container (creates a tracking request)
2. List shipments
3. Get container details
4. Get shipment details
5. Get container events
6. Get routing details

Replace the placeholder IDs with real values from your account.

```ts
import { Terminal49Client } from '@terminal49/sdk';

const client = new Terminal49Client({
  apiToken: process.env.T49_API_TOKEN!,
});

// 1) Track a container (creates a tracking request)
// Provide a SCAC for more reliable inference when known.
await client.trackingRequests.createFromInfer('MAEU1234567', {
  scac: 'MAEU',
});

// 2) List shipments (example: most recently updated)
const shipments = await client.shipments.list({
  updatedAfter: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z',
});

// 3) Get container details
const containerId = 'your-container-uuid';
const container = await client.containers.get(containerId, ['shipment', 'pod_terminal']);

// 4) Get shipment details
const shipmentId = 'your-shipment-uuid';
const shipment = await client.shipments.get(shipmentId, true);

// 5) Get container events (milestones + timeline)
const events = await client.containers.events(containerId);

// 6) Get container route (multi-leg itinerary + vessels)
const route = await client.containers.route(containerId);

console.log({ shipments, container, shipment, events, route });
```

## Get updates via webhooks

For near real-time updates, set up webhooks and store the payloads in your system.
