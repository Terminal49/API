title: SDK Maturity
---

The TypeScript SDK is under active development. You should expect minor API changes until the `1.0.0` release.

## Versioning

- Pre-1.0 releases may include breaking changes in minor versions.
- After 1.0, we will follow semantic versioning.

## Staying current

- Watch release notes in the repository.
- Regenerate your integration tests whenever you upgrade.
