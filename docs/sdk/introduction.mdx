The Terminal49 TypeScript SDK lets you track containers, retrieve shipment data, and receive status updates from your Node.js applications.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- A Terminal49 API key ([get one here](https://app.terminal49.com/developers))

## Install

```bash
npm install @terminal49/sdk
```

## Setup

Store your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export T49_API_TOKEN=your_api_key
```

Then initialize the client:

```typescript
import { Terminal49Client } from '@terminal49/sdk';

const client = new Terminal49Client({
  apiToken: process.env.T49_API_TOKEN!,
});
```

## What you can do

- **Track containers** — Create tracking requests by container number, booking number, or bill of lading
- **List shipments and containers** — Query with filters by status, port, carrier, or date
- **Get transport events** — Pull milestones, timestamps, and location updates
- **Fetch routing details** — See the full journey including vessels and ports

For real-time updates, set up [webhooks](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/webhooks) to receive status changes as they happen.
