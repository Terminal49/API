This walkthrough shows the most common SDK operations: creating a tracking request, listing shipments, and fetching container details.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [installed the SDK](/sdk/introduction) and set your `T49_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Complete example

```typescript
import { Terminal49Client } from '@terminal49/sdk';

const client = new Terminal49Client({
  apiToken: process.env.T49_API_TOKEN!,
});

async function main() {
  // 1) Track a container (creates a tracking request)
  // Provide a SCAC for faster, more reliable inference when known.
  await client.trackingRequests.createFromInfer('MSCU1234567', {
    scac: 'MSCU',
  });

  // 2) List your shipments (mapped response)
  const shipments = await client.shipments.list(
    { updatedAfter: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' },
    { format: 'mapped' },
  );
  console.log(`Found ${shipments.items.length} shipments`);

  // 3) Get a specific container with related data (raw JSON:API)
  const containerId = 'your-container-uuid';
  const container = await client.containers.get(containerId, [
    'shipment',
    'pod_terminal',
  ]);
  console.log(container.data?.id);

  // 4) Get transport events (milestones and timeline)
  const events = await client.containers.events(containerId, {
    format: 'mapped',
  });
  console.log(`Container has ${events.length} events`);

  // 5) Get routing details (vessels, ports, legs)
  const route = await client.containers.route(containerId, {
    format: 'mapped',
  });
  console.log(`Route has ${route.locations.length} locations`);
}

main();
```

## What’s happening

**Tracking requests** tell Terminal49 to start monitoring a container. You can track by container number, booking number, or bill of lading. Once tracked, Terminal49 polls carriers and terminals for updates.

**Shipments** are the parent objects that group related containers. A single bill of lading might have multiple containers.

**Events** are individual milestones: gate out, vessel departure, discharge, and more. Each event has a timestamp, location, and description.

**Routes** show the planned and actual journey, broken into locations with inbound and outbound legs.
