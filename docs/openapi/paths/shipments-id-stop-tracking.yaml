  description: "We'll stop tracking the shipment, which means that there will be no more updates.  You can still access the shipment's previously-collected information via the API or dashboard.\n\nYou can resume tracking a shipment by calling the `resume_tracking` endpoint, but keep in mind that some information is only made available by our data sources at specific times, so a stopped and resumed shipment may have some information missing."
