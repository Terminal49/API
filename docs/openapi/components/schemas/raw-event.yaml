description: "Raw Events represent the milestones from the shipping line for a given container.\n\n### About raw_event datetimes\n\nThe events may include estimated future events. The event is a future event if an `estimated_` timestamp is not null. \n\nThe datetime properties `timestamp` and `estimated`. \n\nWhen the `time_zone` property is present the datetimes are UTC timestamps, which can be converted to the local time by parsing the provided `time_zone`.\n\nWhen the `time_zone` property is absent, the datetimes represent local times which serialized as UTC timestamps for consistency.
