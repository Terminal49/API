title: API Data Sources and Availability.
description: Our platform gets data from variety of sources in order to create a complete view of a shipment and containers. However,some data is not universally available from all sources, and some data does not become available until certain milestones pass. This page will help you understand which data sources we support, and which data items should be universally expected by your code and which you need to code more defensively around.
---
# Data Sources

- **Ocean carriers (aka steamship lines):** bill of lading/booking details, vessel eta, containers and milestones
- **Container terminal operators:** container availability, last free day, holds, fees etc
- **Container rail carriers:** container milestones via rail
- **AIS data:** vessel details and real-time location tracking (coming soon!)

In addition to some data not being provided by all carriers, there are a couple other known issues:

- BNSF does not provide an event history - we construct it. So we might miss events that happened before tracking began, or that happened in close succession between times we retrieved new data.
- ETAs are notoriously incorrect (we're working on a way to improve on what we get from the carriers)

# Data Fields & Availability

Below is a list of data that can be retrieved via the API, including whether is is always available, or whether it is only supported by certain carriers (Carrier Dependent), certain Terminals (Terminal Dependent) or on certain types of journeys (Journey dependent).

## Shipment Data
Shipment Data is the primary data that comes from the Carrier. It containers the details of the shipment retrieved from the Bill of Lading, and references multiple container objects.
