## How It Works

**Container Numbers:**

- Deterministic lookup using BIC prefix mapping (~135 known prefixes)
- ISO 6346 check digit validation
- Confidence is always 1.0 when prefix is found

**Shipment Numbers (BL/Booking):**

- ML-based prediction with variable confidence (0.0 - 1.0)
- Decision thresholds: `auto_select` (≥0.95), `needs_confirmation` (0.70-0.95), `no_prediction` (&lt;0.70)

<Warning>
  This endpoint is rate limited to 200 requests per minute per API key.
