<Info>
  **Beta Feature** - This endpoint is currently in beta. The API is stable, but
  the schema and behavior may evolve based on feedback.
</Info>

## What this endpoint does

Give us a tracking number (container, bill of lading, or booking). We return:

- The **predicted VOCC carrier SCAC** to use for tracking
- The **predicted number type**
- A confidence-driven **decision** (`auto_select`, `needs_confirmation`, `no_prediction`)

<Info>
  We use machine learning prediction across container, bill of lading, and
  booking numbers. For container numbers, we leverage tens of millions of
  historical container movements to predict which carrier is moving the
  container (about 9 out of 10 times).

## How to use the result

<Warning>
  This endpoint is rate limited to 200 requests per minute per API key.
