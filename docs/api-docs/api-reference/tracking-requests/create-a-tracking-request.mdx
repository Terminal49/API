openapi: post /tracking_requests
---

## Endpoint Purpose
Submitting a tracking request tells Terminal49 to start monitoring a specific shipment for you. This is typically the first step in the tracking workflow.

## Business Use Cases
- **Initial Tracking Setup**: Start tracking a new container shipment when you receive a bill of lading or booking confirmation.
- **Customer Onboarding**: Quickly set up tracking for a customer's shipments when they provide their shipping documents.
- **Bulk Import**: Programmatically submit multiple tracking requests to monitor your entire inventory in transit.

## Example Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track by Bill of Lading">
    ```json title="Request"
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
          "scac": "MAEU"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json title="Response"
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "b9c6a3e0-411e-4378-b93c-aacea42a673e",
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
          "scac": "MAEU",
          "status": "pending",
          "failed_reason": null,
          "created_at": "2023-05-15T14:23:12Z",
          "updated_at": "2023-05-15T14:23:12Z"
        },
        "relationships": {
          "shipment": {
            "data": null
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes:**
    - The bill of lading is typically the most reliable identifier for tracking shipments.
    - The `status` will initially be `pending` while Terminal49 processes your request.
    - Once processing completes, you'll receive a webhook notification and the status will change to `succeeded` or `failed`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track by Container Number">
    ```json title="Request"
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "container",
          "request_number": "MSCU1234567",
          "scac": "MSCU"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json title="Response"
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "f7c9b5d2-311e-4378-a91c-bbcea42a785f",
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "container",
          "request_number": "MSCU1234567",
          "scac": "MSCU",
          "status": "pending",
          "failed_reason": null,
          "created_at": "2023-05-15T15:45:22Z",
          "updated_at": "2023-05-15T15:45:22Z"
        },
        "relationships": {
          "shipment": {
            "data": null
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes:**
    - Container number tracking support varies between carriers. Refer to the Carrier Data Matrix to verify support.
    - Container numbers should include the carrier prefix (e.g., MSCU for MSC containers).
    - Container tracking can sometimes fail if the container is very new or not yet associated with a booking in the carrier's system.

          "scac": "TEST"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```json title="Response"
    {
      "data": {
        "id": "e8d7c6b5-211d-4378-a81b-aacfa42a895e",
        "type": "tracking_request",

            "data": null
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes:**
    - Using test numbers is perfect for development and testing your integration.
    - `TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED` will always trigger a successful tracking response.
    - `TEST-TR-FAILED` will always trigger a failed tracking response.
    - These test numbers will trigger corresponding webhook events for complete testing.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My tracking request is stuck in 'pending' status">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request has been in "pending" status for an extended period.

    **Solution**:
    1. Terminal49 retries tracking requests up to 14 times over 24 hours.
    2. Check that the SCAC and request number are correct.
    3. For bill of lading numbers, note that they may remain in "awaiting_manifest" status for up to 7 days.
    4. If the issue persists beyond 24 hours, contact support@terminal49.com.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tracking request failed with 'not_found'">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request failed with reason "not_found".

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify the tracking number format is correct (no spaces, proper prefixes).
    2. Confirm you're using the correct SCAC code for the carrier.
    3. For newly issued bills of lading, try again in 24-48 hours as it may take time to appear in the carrier's system.
    4. If using a container number, check if the carrier supports container tracking in the Carrier Data Matrix.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I received a duplicate error">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request failed with reason "duplicate".

    **Solution**:
    1. The shipment is already being tracked in Terminal49.
    2. Use `GET /shipments` with a filter to find the existing shipment:

    ```bash
    GET /shipments?filter[bill_of_lading_number]=MAEU9736478
    ```

    3. You can access the existing shipment data instead of creating a new tracking request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Track by Booking Number">
    **Scenario**: You want to create a tracking request using a booking number.

    **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "booking_number",
          "request_number": "OOLU8324567",
          "scac": "OOLU"
        },
        "type": "tracking_request"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes**:
    - Booking numbers are typically issued by the carrier early in the shipping process
    - Using booking numbers allows you to start tracking earlier in the shipping lifecycle
    - Booking number format varies by carrier (e.g., OOLU prefix for ONE Line bookings)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Including Reference Numbers">
    **Scenario**: You want to add your own reference numbers to help identify the shipment.

    **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "MEDUFR030802",
          "scac": "MSCU",
          "ref_numbers": [
            "PO12345",
            "HBL12345",
            "INV9876"
          ]
        },
        "type": "tracking_request"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes**:
    - Reference numbers can include purchase orders, house bills of lading, invoice numbers, etc.
    - You can add multiple reference numbers to a single tracking request
    - These numbers will be searchable later through the API and UI
    - You can use reference numbers to link shipments to your internal systems
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Adding Tags">
    **Scenario**: You want to categorize your shipments with tags for easier filtering.

    **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
          "scac": "MAEU",
          "shipment_tags": [
            "priority",
            "electronics",
            "q2-2023"
          ]
        },
        "type": "tracking_request"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes**:
    - Tags provide a flexible way to group and categorize shipments
    - Common uses include priority levels, product categories, or time periods
    - Tags can be used for filtering when listing shipments
    - You can add or remove tags later using the Edit Shipment endpoint
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Associating with a Customer">
    **Scenario**: You're tracking shipments on behalf of your customers and want to associate shipments with specific customers.

    **Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
          "scac": "MAEU"
        },
        "relationships": {
          "customer": {
            "data": {
              "id": "f7cb530a-9e60-412c-a5bc-205a2f34ba54",
              "type": "party"
            }
          }
        },
        "type": "tracking_request"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notes**:
    - The customer must first be created using the Parties API
    - The customer ID is used to link the shipment to the specific customer
    - This association enables filtering shipments by customer
    - Customer information will be included in webhook notifications when using appropriate includes
    - See the [Adding Customer guide](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/adding-customer) for more details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  For the fastest tracking setup, use the master bill of lading (MBL) number from the carrier. House bills of lading (HBL) are not supported.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Container number tracking is not supported by all carriers. Always check the Carrier Data Matrix before implementing container tracking.
</Warning>
