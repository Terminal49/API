## Endpoint Purpose
Submitting a tracking request tells Terminal49 to start monitoring a specific shipment for you. This is typically the first step in the tracking workflow.

## Business Use Cases
- **Initial Tracking Setup**: Start tracking a new container shipment when you receive a bill of lading or booking confirmation.
- **Customer Onboarding**: Quickly set up tracking for a customer's shipments when they provide their shipping documents.
- **Bulk Import**: Programmatically submit multiple tracking requests to monitor your entire inventory in transit.

## Example Scenarios

      <Code title="Request" lang="json">

      "scac": "MAEU"
    }
  }
}
```
      </Code>
      <Code title="Response" lang="json">

    "type": "tracking_request",

      "scac": "MAEU",
      "status": "pending",
      "failed_reason": null,
      "created_at": "2023-05-15T14:23:12Z",
      "updated_at": "2023-05-15T14:23:12Z"
    },

        "data": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```
      </Code>
    </CodeGroup>

    **Notes:**
    - The bill of lading is typically the most reliable identifier for tracking shipments.
    - The `status` will initially be `pending` while Terminal49 processes your request.
    - Once processing completes, you'll receive a webhook notification and the status will change to `succeeded` or `failed`.

      </Code>
    </CodeGroup>

    **Notes:**
    - Container number tracking support varies between carriers. Refer to the Carrier Data Matrix to verify support.
    - Container numbers should include the carrier prefix (e.g., MSCU for MSC containers).
    - Container tracking can sometimes fail if the container is very new or not yet associated with a booking in the carrier's system.

    **Notes:**
    - Using test numbers is perfect for development and testing your integration.
    - `TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED` will always trigger a successful tracking response.
    - `TEST-TR-FAILED` will always trigger a failed tracking response.
    - These test numbers will trigger corresponding webhook events for complete testing.

## Related Webhook Events

When creating a tracking request, you may receive the following webhook events:

<Card title="tracking_request.succeeded">
  Sent when Terminal49 successfully locates your shipment and begins tracking it. The notification includes details about the created shipment and its containers.
</Card>

<Card title="tracking_request.failed">
  Sent when Terminal49 is unable to locate your shipment after all retry attempts. Includes the failed_reason to help troubleshoot.
</Card>

<Card title="tracking_request.awaiting_manifest">
  Sent when the bill of lading number is valid but the shipment data is not yet available in the carrier's system. Terminal49 will continue checking daily.
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My tracking request is stuck in 'pending' status">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request has been in "pending" status for an extended period.

    **Solution**:
    1. Terminal49 retries tracking requests up to 14 times over 24 hours.
    2. Check that the SCAC and request number are correct.
    3. For bill of lading numbers, note that they may remain in "awaiting_manifest" status for up to 7 days.
    4. If the issue persists beyond 24 hours, contact support@terminal49.com.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tracking request failed with 'not_found'">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request failed with reason "not_found".

    **Solution**:
    1. Verify the tracking number format is correct (no spaces, proper prefixes).
    2. Confirm you're using the correct SCAC code for the carrier.
    3. For newly issued bills of lading, try again in 24-48 hours as it may take time to appear in the carrier's system.
    4. If using a container number, check if the carrier supports container tracking in the Carrier Data Matrix.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I received a duplicate error">
    **Problem**: Your tracking request failed with reason "duplicate".

    **Solution**:
    1. The shipment is already being tracked in Terminal49.
    2. Use `GET /shipments` with a filter to find the existing shipment:

    ```bash
    GET /shipments?filter[bill_of_lading_number]=MAEU9736478
    ```

    3. You can access the existing shipment data instead of creating a new tracking request.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  For the fastest tracking setup, use the master bill of lading (MBL) number from the carrier. House bills of lading (HBL) are not supported.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Container number tracking is not supported by all carriers. Always check the Carrier Data Matrix before implementing container tracking.
</Warning>
