description: Learn about the different container status values and their meanings throughout the container journey lifecycle.

The `current_status` attribute on container objects provides a high-level view of where a container is in its journey. This guide explains the different status values and their meanings.

## Available Status Values

The `current_status` field can have one of the following values:

### new
**Default state** - The container is tracked but we don't yet have enough information to determine its actual status. This is the initial state when tracking begins.

### on_ship
**In transit by vessel** - The container is on a ship at any point prior to arrival at the Port of Discharge (POD). This status can apply at multiple stages:
- During the ocean voyage from origin to destination
- Before vessel departure from the Port of Lading
- Any time the container is loaded on a vessel

### available
**Ready for pickup** - The container has arrived at the POD or inland destination and is confirmed available for pickup. You can proceed with arranging pickup when you see this status.

### not_available
**Arrived but not ready** - The container is at the POD or inland destination but is not yet available for pickup. This could be due to:
- Customs holds
- Terminal holds
- Documentation requirements
- Other restrictions

### grounded
**Availability unknown** - The container is physically at the POD, but we don't currently know whether it's available for pickup or not. This typically means the terminal isn't providing real-time availability data.

### awaiting_inland_transfer
**Moving inland** - The container is either:
- Still at the POD waiting to be loaded onto rail for an inland move
- In transit between the POD and a rail terminal
- At a rail terminal but not yet loaded onto a rail car

This status is specific to shipments with inland rail movements.

### on_rail
**In transit by rail** - The container has been loaded onto a rail car and is being transported to its inland destination.

### picked_up
**Out for delivery** - The container has been picked up from the terminal or facility and is currently being transported to its final destination.

### off_dock
**At alternative facility** - The container has been moved to a different terminal or off-dock storage facility for pickup. You may need to go to this alternative location rather than the original POD terminal.

### delivered
**Delivery confirmed** - This status is only shown when delivery has been manually confirmed through the Terminal49 dashboard. It indicates successful delivery to the final destination.

### empty_returned
**Container returned empty** - The container has been emptied and returned to the shipping line or designated return location. This typically marks the end of the container's tracked journey.

### dropped
**Not currently used** - This status value is defined but not actively used in the system.

### loaded
**Not currently used** - This status value is defined but not actively used in the system.

## Important Considerations

### Status Accuracy
The logic to derive container statuses is complex and involves processing data from multiple sources including:
- Shipping line updates
- Terminal systems
- Rail carrier feeds
- Manual updates

**There can sometimes be errors in the reported `current_status`**. When making critical business decisions, we recommend:
- Cross-referencing with transport events
- Checking raw event data when available
- Contacting the terminal directly for time-sensitive pickups

### Status Transitions
Containers don't always follow a linear path through these statuses. For example:
- A container may go from `on_ship` directly to `available` if terminal data arrives quickly
- A container might alternate between `available` and `not_available` if holds are placed and removed
- The status may remain as `new` for some time if data from the shipping line is delayed

### API Usage
To get the current status of a container, include the container's `current_status` attribute in your API responses:

```bash
GET /v2/containers/{id}
```

The response will include:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "type": "container",
    "attributes": {
      "number": "ABCU1234567",
      "current_status": "available",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering by Status
You can also filter containers by their current status when listing:

```bash
GET /v2/containers?current_status=available
```

This is useful for workflows like:
- Finding all containers ready for pickup
- Identifying containers still in transit
- Locating containers that need attention (e.g., `not_available` due to holds)
