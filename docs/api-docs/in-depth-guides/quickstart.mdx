## Before You Begin

You'll need a four things to get started.

1. **A Bill of Lading (BOL) number.** This is issued by your carrier. BOL numbers are found on your [bill of lading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_lading) document. Ideally, this will be a shipment that is currently on the water or in terminal, but this is not necessary.
2. **The SCAC of the carrier that issued your bill of lading.** The Standard Carrier Alpha Code of your carrier is used to identify carriers in computer systems and in shipping documents. You can learn more about these [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Carrier_Alpha_Code).
3. **A Terminal49 Account.** If you don't have one yet, [sign up here.](https://app.terminal49.com/register)
4. **An API key.** Sign in to your Terminal49 account and go to your [developer portal page](https://app.terminal49.com/developers) to get your API key.

## Track a Shipment

You can try this using the embedded request maker below, or using Postman.

1. Try it below. Click "Headers" and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key. In the authorization header value.
2. Enter a value for the `request_number` and `scac`. The request number has to be a shipping line booking or master bill of lading number. The SCAC has to be a shipping line scac (see data sources to get a list of valid SCACs)

Note that you can also access sample code, include a cURL template, by clicking the "Code Generation" tab in the Request Maker.

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": "{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"attributes\": {\r\n      \"request_type\": \"bill_of_lading\",\r\n      \"request_number\": \"\",\r\n      \"scac\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"type\": \"tracking_request\"\r\n  }\r\n}"
}
```

## Set Up Webhooks (Recommended)

The recommended way to integrate with Terminal49 is through webhooks. Instead of polling our API for updates, webhooks push real-time notifications to your system whenever there are changes to your shipments and containers.

<Note>
**Why webhooks?** Webhooks are more efficient than polling—you receive updates instantly without making repeated API calls. This reduces latency, lowers your API usage, and ensures you never miss an update.
</Note>

To set up a webhook, you'll need a URL on the open web to receive POST requests. You can use a service like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) for testing.

**Try it below. Click "Headers" and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.**

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/webhooks",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": "{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"type\": \"webhook\",\r\n    \"attributes\": {\r\n      \"url\": \"https://webhook.site/\",\r\n      \"active\": true,\r\n      \"events\": [\r\n        \"*\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}"
}
```

Once configured, you'll automatically receive notifications for:
- Tracking request status changes (`tracking_request.succeeded`, `tracking_request.failed`)
- Container transport events (vessel departed, arrived, discharged, etc.)
- ETA changes and container availability updates
- Last Free Day (LFD) changes

See the [Webhooks guide](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/webhooks) for the full list of events and payload examples.

## Check Your Tracking Request Succeeded (Polling)

If you haven't set up webhooks yet, you can manually poll to check if the Tracking Request has succeeded or failed. However, we recommend setting up webhooks above for production integrations.



> ### Tracking Request Troubleshooting
> The most common issue people encounter is that they are  entering the wrong number.
>
> Please check that you are entering the Bill of Lading number, booking number, or container number and not internal reference at your company or by your frieght forwarder. You can the number you are supplying by going to a carrier's website and using their tools to track your shipment using the request number. If this works, and if the SCAC is supported by T49, you should able to track it with us.
>
> You can always email us at support@terminal49.com if you have persistent issues.

** Try it below. Click "Headers" and replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your API key.**


```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

## List your Tracked Shipments

If your tracking request was successful, you will now be able to list your tracked shipments.

**Try it below. Click "Headers" and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.**

Sometimes it may take a while for the tracking request to show up, but usually no more than a few minutes.

If you had trouble adding your first shipment, try adding a few more.

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

## List all your Tracked Containers

You can also list out all of your containers, if you'd like to track at that level.

Try it after replacing `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with your API key.

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/containers",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```
