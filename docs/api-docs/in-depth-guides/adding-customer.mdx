title: Adding Customer to a Tracking Request
---

## Adding party for a customer
For adding customer to a tracking request, you need to create a party first. You can create a party through the [API](/api-docs/api-reference/parties/create-a-party).

Endpoint URL: https://api.terminal49.com/v2/parties

```json Request
{
  "data": {
    "type": "party",
    "attributes": {
      "company_name": "COMPANY NAME"
    }
  }
}
```

After you send a **POST** request to create a party, you will receive a response with the Party ID. You can use this Party ID to add the customer to a tracking request.

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "PARTY_ID",
    "type": "party",
    "attributes": {
      "company_name": "COMPANY NAME"
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding customer to a tracking request

To add customer to a tracking request you need to add party to the tracking request as a customer relationship while being created.

Endpoint URL: https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests

```json Request
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MEDUFR030802",
      "ref_numbers": [
        "PO12345",
        "HBL12345",
        "CUSREF1234"
      ],
      "shipment_tags": [
        "camembert"
      ],
      "scac": "MSCU"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "customer": {
        "data": {
          "id": "PARTY_ID",
          "type": "party"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After you send a **POST** request to create a tracking request, you will receive a response with the Tracking Request ID and customer relationship. You can use this tracking request ID to track the shipment.

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "TRACKING_REQUEST_ID",
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MEDUFR030802",
      "ref_numbers": [
        "PO12345",
        "HBL12345",
        "CUSREF1234"
      ],
      "shipment_tags": [
        "camembert"
      ],
      "scac": "MSCU"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "tracked_object": {
        "data": null
      },
      "customer": {
        "data": {
          "id": "PARTY_ID",
          "type": "party"
        }
      }
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/v2/tracking_requests/TRACKING_REQUEST_ID"
    }
  }
}
```
