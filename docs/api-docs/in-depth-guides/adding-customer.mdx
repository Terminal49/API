title: Adding Customer to a Tracking Request
---

## Why you would want to add a party to a tracking request?

Adding a party to a tracking request allows you to associate customer information with the tracking request. This can help in organizing and managing your shipments more effectively.

## How to get the party ID?

You can either find an existing party or create a new one.

- To find an existing party, jump to [Listing all parties](#listing-all-parties) section.
- To create a new party, jump to [Adding party for a customer](#adding-party-for-a-customer) section.

## Listing all parties

You can list all parties associated with your account through the [API](/api-docs/api-reference/parties/list-parties).

Endpoint URL: https://api.terminal49.com/v2/parties

```json Response
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "PARTY_ID_1",
      "type": "party",
      "attributes": {
        "company_name": "COMPANY NAME 1",
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "PARTY_ID_2",
      "type": "party",
      "attributes": {
        "company_name": "COMPANY NAME 2",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Adding party for a customer

For adding a customer to a tracking request, you need to create a party first. You can create a party through the [API](/api-docs/api-reference/parties/create-a-party).

Endpoint URL: https://api.terminal49.com/v2/parties

```json Request
{
  "data": {
    "type": "party",
    "attributes": {
      "company_name": "COMPANY NAME"
    }
  }
}
```

After you send a **POST** request to create a party, you will receive a response with the Party ID. You can use this Party ID to add the customer to a tracking request.

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "PARTY_ID",
    "type": "party",
    "attributes": {
      "company_name": "COMPANY NAME"
    }
  }
}
```

## How to add party to tracking request if you have the party ID?

To add a customer to a tracking request, you need to add the party to the tracking request as a customer relationship while being created.

Endpoint URL: https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests

```json Request
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MEDUFR030802",
      "ref_numbers": [
        "PO12345",
        "HBL12345",
        "CUSREF1234"
      ],
      "shipment_tags": [
        "camembert"
      ],
      "scac": "MSCU"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "customer": {
        "data": {
          "id": "PARTY_ID",
          "type": "party"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After you send a **POST** request to create a tracking request, you will receive a response with the Tracking Request ID and customer relationship. You can use this tracking request ID to track the shipment.

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "id": "TRACKING_REQUEST_ID",
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MEDUFR030802",
      "ref_numbers": [
        "PO12345",
        "HBL12345",
        "CUSREF1234"
      ],
      "shipment_tags": [
        "camembert"
      ],
      "scac": "MSCU"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "tracked_object": {
        "data": null
      },
      "customer": {
        "data": {
          "id": "PARTY_ID",
          "type": "party"
        }
      }
    },

    }
  }
}
```
