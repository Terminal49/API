# Authentication with Terminal49

This guide covers everything you need to know about authentication with Terminal49's API, including obtaining API keys, implementing authentication in your code, and security best practices.

## How Terminal49 Authentication Works

Terminal49 uses a token-based authentication system. Each request to the API must include an API key in the request headers to authenticate the request.

<Note>
  Authentication is required for all API endpoints except for the documentation and health check endpoints.
</Note>

## Getting Your API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Sign in to your Terminal49 account
2. Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://app.terminal49.com/developers/api-keys)
3. Click "Generate New API Key"
4. Name your key based on its intended use (e.g., "Production Integration" or "Development Testing")
5. Copy and securely store your API key - you won't be able to view it again

<Warning>
  API keys grant access to your data and should be kept secure. Never share your API key or commit it to version control systems.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

When making requests to the Terminal49 API, you need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request with the prefix `Token`.

```
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```

Here's how to include the Authorization header in different programming languages:

```javascript title="JavaScript/Node.js"
// Using fetch API
const response = await fetch('https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.api+json'
  }
});

// Using Axios
const axios = require('axios');
axios.get('https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Token YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.api+json'
  }
});
```

```python title="Python"
import requests

url = "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

```ruby title="Ruby"
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'
require 'json'

uri = URI.parse('https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments')
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
request['Authorization'] = 'Token YOUR_API_KEY'
request['Content-Type'] = 'application/vnd.api+json'

response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
  http.request(request)
end
```

```csharp title="C#"
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        using var client = new HttpClient();
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Authorization", "Token YOUR_API_KEY");
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Content-Type", "application/vnd.api+json");

        var response = await client.GetAsync("https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments");
        var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        Console.WriteLine(content);
    }
}
```

## API Key Management Best Practices

### Security Recommendations

1. **Store API keys securely**: Use environment variables or a secure vault instead of hardcoding them
2. **Implement key rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys (e.g., every 90 days)
3. **Use separate keys**: Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments
4. **Limit access**: Only share API keys with team members who need them
5. **Monitor usage**: Regularly review your API usage for unusual patterns

### Environment Variables

Using environment variables is one of the safest ways to handle API keys in your applications:

```javascript title="Node.js with dotenv"
// Install dotenv: npm install dotenv
require('dotenv').config();

const apiKey = process.env.TERMINAL49_API_KEY;

const response = await fetch('https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Token ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.api+json'
  }
});
```

```python title="Python with dotenv"
# Install python-dotenv: pip install python-dotenv
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import requests

load_dotenv()
api_key = os.getenv("TERMINAL49_API_KEY")

url = "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

### Example .env File

```
# .env file (add to .gitignore)
TERMINAL49_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Warning>
  Always add your .env file to .gitignore to prevent accidentally committing it to version control.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

### Common Error Responses

| HTTP Status | Message | Possible Cause |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 401 Unauthorized | "Invalid API Key" | The API key is incorrect or has been revoked |
| 401 Unauthorized | "Missing API Key" | No Authorization header was provided |
| 403 Forbidden | "Insufficient permissions" | The API key doesn't have permission for the requested action |

### Debugging Tips

1. **Check the Authorization header**: Ensure it's properly formatted as `Token YOUR_API_KEY`
2. **Verify the API key**: Check that you're using the correct API key for the environment
3. **Test with curl**: Try a simple curl request to isolate authentication issues

```bash title="curl Example"
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
     https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments
```

## Revoking API Keys

If an API key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Sign in to your Terminal49 account
2. Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://app.terminal49.com/developers/api-keys)
3. Find the API key you want to revoke
4. Click "Revoke Key"

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key is immediate and permanent. Any applications using the key will lose access to the API.
</Warning>
