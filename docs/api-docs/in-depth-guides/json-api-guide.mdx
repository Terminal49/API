# JSON:API Guide

Terminal49's API follows the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/), a standard for building APIs in JSON. This guide will help you understand the key concepts and how to work with our API effectively.

## What is JSON:API?

JSON:API is a specification for how a client should request resources to be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond. It's designed to minimize both the number of requests and the amount of data transmitted between clients and servers.

<Note>
  The Terminal49 API conforms to the JSON:API v1.0 specification. This standardization makes our API more predictable and easier to work with once you understand the patterns.

## Why Terminal49 Uses JSON:API

Terminal49 uses the JSON:API specification for a number of important reasons that directly benefit developers working with shipping and container tracking data:

### Standardized Relationships for Complex Shipping Data

Shipping data is inherently relational - containers belong to shipments, shipments have transport events, containers have tracking events, and all these relate to carriers, terminals, and vessels. JSON:API excels at representing these complex relationships through:

- **Consistent Structure**: Every response follows the same pattern, making data predictable and easy to parse
- **Clear Resource Relationships**: Explicit definition of how resources like shipments, containers, and events relate to each other
- **Compound Documents**: The ability to include related resources in a single request, eliminating the need for multiple API calls

### Efficient Data Loading for Shipping Operations

JSON:API's approach to related data is particularly valuable for shipping operations:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "shipment",
    "attributes": {
      "bill_of_lading_number": "MAEU1234567",
      "carrier_name": "Maersk"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "containers": {
        "data": [
          { "id": "456", "type": "container" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "456",
      "type": "container",
      "attributes": {
        "number": "MRKU1234567",
        "size_type": "40HC"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This allows Terminal49 to deliver a complete picture of your shipping data in fewer requests, which means:

- **Reduced API Calls**: Get containers and their shipments in a single request
- **Minimized Latency**: Critical for time-sensitive logistics operations
- **Lower Bandwidth**: Only request the related objects you need, when you need them

### Standardized Error Handling

JSON:API provides a consistent format for error responses, making it easier to:

- **Identify Issues**: Clearly pinpoint which field or relationship has an error
- **Implement Error Handling**: Write consistent error handling logic across your application
- **Debug Problems**: Receive detailed information about what went wrong and why

## Client Libraries <Icon name="puzzle-piece" />

Instead of writing custom code to parse JSON:API responses, you can leverage ready-made libraries for most programming languages:

These libraries provide significant benefits when working with Terminal49's API:

- **Automatic Relationship Resolution**: Easily navigate from shipments to containers and events without manual mapping
- **Type Conversion**: Convert API responses into native language objects/models
- **Query Building**: Construct complex API queries with simple, intuitive methods
- **Consistent Updates**: Standardized methods for creating and updating resources
- **Error Handling**: Built-in support for JSON:API error formats

Using these libraries can reduce development time by up to 50% when working with complex shipping data structures, allowing you to focus on your business logic rather than API parsing details.

## JSON:API Structure

### Basic Resource Objects

All Terminal49 API responses follow this general structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "shipment",
    "attributes": {
      "bill_of_lading_number": "MAEU9736478",
      "created_at": "2023-05-15T14:23:12Z"
      // Other shipment attributes
    },
    "relationships": {
      "containers": {
        "data": [
          { "id": "456", "type": "container" },
          { "id": "789", "type": "container" }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The main components are:

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  The primary resource or collection of resources.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the resource.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  The resource type (e.g., "shipment", "container", "tracking_request").
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="attributes" type="object">
  The resource's properties (e.g., numbers, dates, status values).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="relationships" type="object">
  References to related resources (e.g., a shipment's containers).
</ResponseField>

### Collections of Resources

When requesting multiple resources, the response structure is:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "type": "shipment",
      "attributes": { ... }
    },
    {
      "id": "124",
      "type": "shipment",
      "attributes": { ... }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total_count": 45
  },
  "links": {
    "self": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments?page[number]=1&page[size]=2",
    "next": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/shipments?page[number]=2&page[size]=2"
  }
}
```

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Contains non-standard meta-information, like counts or pagination details.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="links" type="object">
  Contains links for pagination or related operations.
</ResponseField>

## Working with JSON:API in Terminal49

### Creating Resources

When creating a resource (like a tracking request), your request should follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
      "scac": "MAEU"
    }
  }
}
```

Notice that:
- The `type` field is required and must match the expected resource type
- All properties go inside the `attributes` object
- You don't specify an `id` for new resources (the server assigns it)

### Including Related Resources

One powerful feature of JSON:API is the ability to include related resources in a single request using the `include` parameter:

```
GET /shipments/123?include=containers,containers.transport_events
```

This returns the shipment with its containers and each container's transport events in one response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "type": "shipment",
    "attributes": { ... },
    "relationships": {
      "containers": {
        "data": [
          { "id": "456", "type": "container" }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "id": "456",
      "type": "container",
      "attributes": { ... },
      "relationships": {
        "transport_events": {
          "data": [
            { "id": "789", "type": "transport_event" }
          ]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "789",
      "type": "transport_event",
      "attributes": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

<ResponseField name="included" type="array">
  Contains all the related resources referenced in the main resource's relationships.
</ResponseField>

### Error Handling

Error responses also follow a standard format:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "status": "422",
      "title": "Invalid attribute",
      "detail": "The SCAC 'UNKNOWN' is not supported.",
      "source": {
        "pointer": "/data/attributes/scac"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each error object contains:

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  The HTTP status code relevant to the error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="title" type="string">
  A short, human-readable summary of the problem.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="detail" type="string">
  A human-readable explanation of the specific error.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="source" type="object">
  An object containing references to the source of the error. The `pointer` field typically contains a JSON Pointer to the specific field that caused the error.
</ResponseField>

## Tips for Working with Terminal49's JSON:API

- Always include the correct `Content-Type` header in your requests:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
  ```

- Use the `include` parameter to reduce the number of API calls when you need related resources

- When creating or updating resources, remember that all properties must be inside the `attributes` object

- For filtering collections, use the filter query parameter with the attribute name:
  ```
  GET /containers?filter[status]=arrived
  ```

- Pagination is handled via `page[number]` and `page[size]` query parameters
