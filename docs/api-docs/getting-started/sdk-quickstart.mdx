title: 2. SDK Quickstart (TypeScript)
---

Use the Terminal49 TypeScript SDK to create tracking requests, pull shipment/container data, and drill into events or routing.

This SDK is **server-side only** and requires Node 18+.

## Install

```bash
npm install @terminal49/sdk
```

## Configure the client

```ts
import { Terminal49Client } from '@terminal49/sdk';

const client = new Terminal49Client({
  apiToken: process.env.T49_API_TOKEN!,
});
```

## Use case: track a container and pull details

This example walks through the common flow:
1. Track a container (creates a tracking request)
2. List shipments
3. Get container details
4. Get shipment details
5. Get container events
6. Get routing details

Replace the placeholder IDs with real values from your account.

```ts
import { Terminal49Client } from '@terminal49/sdk';

const client = new Terminal49Client({
  apiToken: process.env.T49_API_TOKEN!,
});

// 1) Track a container (creates a tracking request)
// You can provide a SCAC for better inference if you know it.
await client.trackingRequests.createFromInfer('MAEU1234567', {
  scac: 'MAEU',
});

// 2) List shipments (example: most recently updated)
const shipments = await client.shipments.list({
  updatedAfter: '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z',
});

// 3) Get container details
const containerId = 'your-container-uuid';
const container = await client.containers.get(containerId, ['shipment', 'pod_terminal']);

// 4) Get shipment details
const shipmentId = 'your-shipment-uuid';
const shipment = await client.shipments.get(shipmentId, true);

// 5) Get container events (milestones + timeline)
const events = await client.containers.events(containerId);

// 6) Get container route (multi-leg itinerary + vessels)
const route = await client.containers.route(containerId);

console.log({ shipments, container, shipment, events, route });
```

## Get updates via webhooks

For near real-time updates, set up webhooks and store the payloads in your system. Start here:

- [Receive status updates](./receive-status-updates)
- [Webhooks guide](../in-depth-guides/webhooks)

## Next steps

- Use [Including Resources](../in-depth-guides/including-resources) to control related data payloads.
- See [Tracking Request Lifecycle](../in-depth-guides/tracking-request-lifecycle) for what happens after creation.
