So you want to start tracking your ocean shipments and containers and you have a few BL numbers. Follow the guide.

Our API responses use [JSONAPI](https://jsonapi.org/) schema. There are [client libraries](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries) available in almost every language. Our API should work with these libs out of the box.

Our APIs can be used with any HTTP client; choose your favorite! We love Postman, it's a friendly graphical interface to a powerful cross-platform HTTP client. Best of all it has support for the OpenAPI specs that we publish with all our APIs. We have created a collection of requests for you to easily test the API endpoints with your API Key. Link to the collection below.

## Get an API Key
Sign in to your Terminal49 account and go to your [developer portal](https://app.terminal49.com/developers/api_keys) page to get your API key.

### Authentication
When passing your API key it should be prefixed with `Token`. For example, if your API Key is 'ABC123' then your Authorization header would look like:

```
"Authorization": "Token ABC123"
```
