## API Basics

Our API follows the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification, providing a standardized way to request and manipulate resources. This makes our API predictable and easier to work with.

<Accordion title="Understanding JSON:API">
  All Terminal49 API responses follow the JSON:API structure:

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "id": "123",
      "type": "shipment",
      "attributes": {
        "bill_of_lading_number": "MAEU9736478",
        // Other shipment attributes
      },
      "relationships": {
        "containers": {
          "data": [
            { "id": "456", "type": "container" }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  For more details, see our [JSON:API Guide](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/json-api-guide).
</Accordion>

There are [client libraries](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries) available in almost every language. Our API should work with these libraries out of the box, making integration easier.

## Tools to Get Started

Our APIs can be used with any HTTP client. We've created a Postman collection so you can quickly test endpoints with your API key:

  **Run in Postman**

## Get an API Key

Sign in to your Terminal49 account and go to your [developer portal](https://app.terminal49.com/developers/api-keys) page to get your API key.

### Authentication

When passing your API key, it should be prefixed with `Token`. For example, if your API Key is 'ABC123' then your Authorization header would look like:

```
"Authorization": "Token ABC123"
```
