<Tip>
Tracking is a core function of Terminal49's platform. This guide covers all aspects of tracking shipments and containers, from initiating tracking through various methods to understanding the tracking request lifecycle and managing tracking data.
</Tip>

## Tracking Methods

Terminal49 offers multiple ways to start tracking your shipments or containers:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Terminal49 API" icon="code">
    Use the Tracking Request API to programmatically submit container numbers, bills of lading, or booking numbers for tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Terminal49 Dashboard" icon="browser">
    Manually enter tracking numbers or upload your spreadheet/CSV through Terminal49's web dashboard for immediate tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bulk CSV Upload via Email" icon="file-csv">
    Email CSV files with multiple tracking references to quickly set up tracking for multiple shipments at once.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### API Integration

The most flexible way to integrate tracking into your systems is via the Terminal49 API. Submit tracking requests programmatically using the Tracking Request endpoint:

```bash
POST /v2/tracking_requests
```

This method is ideal for:
- Real-time tracking initiation from your TMS or other internal systems
- Automated tracking workflows
- High-volume tracking needs
- Custom reference data and shipment organization

## Tracking Number Support

Terminal49 supports tracking using three primary reference types:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Master Bill of Lading (MBL)">
    <p>The master bill of lading is issued by the ocean carrier and serves as the contract of carriage.</p>

    **Format Examples:**
    - Maersk: MAEU9736478
    - MSC: MSDUV4812756
    - CMA CGM: CMDUV0946721

    **Best Practices:**
    - MBL is typically the most reliable reference for tracking
    - Include the carrier's SCAC code when submitting
    - Some carriers may not make shipment data available immediately after issuing the MBL

    **Coverage:**
    - Supported by all major ocean carriers
    - Provides visibility from origin to destination
    - Typically covers all containers in a shipment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Booking Number">
    <p>A booking number is assigned by the carrier when space is reserved on a vessel.</p>

    **Format Examples:**
    - Maersk: MAEU785421
    - ONE: OOLU3456723
    - Hapag-Lloyd: HLCUEUR6703426

    **Best Practices:**
    - Use booking numbers to begin tracking earlier in the shipping lifecycle
    - Some carriers include their SCAC code at the beginning of booking numbers
    - Booking numbers may be replaced by bills of lading once issued

    **Coverage:**
    - Available earlier than bills of lading
    - May provide limited information until container assignment
    - Supported by most major carriers (see Carrier Data Matrix for details)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Container Number">
    <p>A container number uniquely identifies a specific shipping container.</p>

    **Format Examples:**
    - MSCU1234567
    - CMAU7654321
    - OOLU8765432

    **Best Practices:**
    - Container numbers follow ISO 6346 format (4 letters + 7 numbers)
    - Always include the carrier prefix (first 4 characters)
    - For multi-container shipments, you'll need to track each container separately

    **Coverage:**
    - Container level detail provides the most granular tracking
    - Not supported by all carriers (check Carrier Data Matrix)
    - May not be available until containers are assigned to a booking
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  House Bill of Lading (HBL) numbers issued by freight forwarders are not directly supported for tracking. You must use the Master Bill of Lading (MBL) from the ocean carrier.
</Warning>

### Dashboard Interface

For manual tracking or lower volumes, Terminal49's web dashboard offers a user-friendly interface:

1. Log in to your Terminal49 account
2. Navigate to the "Track" section
3. Enter your tracking number(s) and select the carrier
4. Click "Track" to begin monitoring

This method is ideal for:
- Quick one-off tracking needs
- Small shipment volumes
- Testing or verification purposes
- Users who prefer a visual interface
### Bulk CSV Upload via Email

For setting up tracking for multiple shipments at once:

1. Prepare a CSV/spreadsheet file with your tracking details
2. Email the file to track@terminal49.com
3. Terminal49 will process the file and begin tracking all shipments

For detailed instructions on CSV formatting options and requirements, see our [help documentation](https://help.terminal49.com/articles/4091681959-how-to-track-shipments-or-containers-via-email).

This method is ideal for:
- Initial onboarding of many shipments
- Regular batch imports from other systems
- Scheduled tracking updates
- Teams that prefer working with spreadsheets




## Tracking Request API Details

  Tags for categorizing shipments (e.g., "priority", "fragile", "q2-2023") that can be used for filtering
</ParamField>

### Relationship Parameters

You can associate the shipment with a customer by establishing a relationship:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "tracking_request",
    "attributes": {
      "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
      "request_number": "MAEU9736478",
      "scac": "MAEU"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "customer": {

</AccordionGroup>

## Tracking Request Lifecycle

When you submit a tracking request, it goes through several possible states:

<img
  src="/images/tracking-request-lifecycle.png"
  alt="Tracking Request Lifecycle"
/>

### Status Transitions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pending" icon="clock">
    Initial state when a tracking request is first submitted. Terminal49 is processing your request and attempting to locate the shipment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Succeeded" icon="check">
    The shipment was successfully located and is now being tracked. A shipment object has been created.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Failed" icon="xmark">
    Unable to locate the shipment after multiple attempts. Check the failed_reason for details.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Awaiting Manifest" icon="calendar">
    The bill of lading number appears valid, but the shipment data isn't yet available in the carrier's system. Terminal49 will continue checking daily.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tracking Stopped" icon="hand">
    Tracking has been manually or automatically stopped for this request.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Failure Reasons

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="not_found">
    The carrier could not locate the shipment using the provided reference number.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    - Verify the reference number format and carrier code
    - For new bookings or bills of lading, wait 24-48 hours and try again
    - Check if the carrier supports the reference type you're using
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="duplicate">
    The shipment is already being tracked in Terminal49.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    - Search for the existing shipment using the List Shipments endpoint
    - Use filters to find the shipment by reference number
    - Use the existing shipment data instead of creating a new tracking request
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="invalid_number">
    The reference number format does not match what the carrier expects.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    - Check for typos and correct formatting
    - Ensure you're including any required prefixes
    - Verify with shipping documents that the number is correct
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="retries_exhausted">
    Terminal49 has attempted to locate the shipment multiple times without success.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    - Verify the reference number and carrier are correct
    - For new shipments, wait a few days and submit a new tracking request
    - Consider using a different reference type if available
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

For a complete list of failure reasons and detailed troubleshooting, see the [Tracking Request Lifecycle guide](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/tracking-request-lifecycle).

## Tracking Request Webhooks

Terminal49 sends webhook notifications at key points in the tracking request lifecycle:

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Learn more about setting up and managing webhooks in the [Webhooks guide](/api-docs/in-depth-guides/webhooks).

## Managing Tracking Requests

### Listing and Searching Tracking Requests

Use the tracking requests index endpoint to retrieve existing tracking requests:

```
GET /v2/tracking_requests
```

Filter by various attributes:

```
GET /v2/tracking_requests?filter[status]=pending
GET /v2/tracking_requests?filter[request_number]=MAEU9736478
GET /v2/tracking_requests?filter[created_at][gt]=2023-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

Sort results:

```
GET /v2/tracking_requests?sort=-created_at
```

Include related resources:

```
GET /v2/tracking_requests?include=shipment
```

### Starting and Stopping Tracking

#### Starting Tracking

To start tracking a new shipment, use the create tracking request endpoint:

```
POST /v2/tracking_requests
```

#### Stopping Tracking

To stop tracking a shipment, use the stop tracking endpoint:

```
POST /v2/shipments/{shipment_id}/stop_tracking
```

<Note>
  Stopping tracking means Terminal49 will no longer fetch updates for this shipment. This is useful for completed shipments or when you no longer need to monitor a shipment.
</Note>

## Testing and Development

Terminal49 provides test tracking numbers for development and integration testing:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Tracking Numbers">
    Use these special test numbers with the SCAC code "TEST" to simulate different scenarios:

    - `TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED` - Always succeeds and creates a test shipment
    - `TEST-TR-FAILED` - Always fails with a "not_found" reason
    - `TEST-TR-AWAITING-MANIFEST` - Simulates an awaiting manifest state
    - `TEST-TR-DELAYED` - Simulates a delayed processing state before succeeding

    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
          "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
          "request_number": "TEST-TR-SUCCEEDED",
          "scac": "TEST"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sandbox Environment">
    Terminal49 provides a sandbox environment for testing your integration without affecting production data:

    - Base URL: `https://sandbox-api.terminal49.com/v2`
    - Requires a separate sandbox API key
    - Simulates real-world scenarios with predictable outcomes
    - Supports all the same endpoints as production

    Contact your Terminal49 account manager to request sandbox access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

1. **Provide SCAC codes**: Always include the carrier's SCAC code to improve tracking success rates.

2. **Use webhooks**: Set up webhook notifications instead of polling for status updates.

3. **Handle retries**: Implement a reasonable retry strategy for failed tracking requests.

4. **Track early**: Start tracking as soon as you have a booking number or bill of lading.

5. **Add reference data**: Include your own reference numbers and tags to make shipments easily identifiable.

6. **Test thoroughly**: Use the test tracking numbers to validate your integration.

7. **Track by MBL when possible**: Master Bills of Lading generally provide the most reliable tracking.

8. **Check carrier support**: Refer to the Carrier Data Matrix to verify which tracking methods are supported by each carrier.
