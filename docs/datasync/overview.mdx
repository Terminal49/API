DataSync is the easiest way to get fresh, up-to-date container and shipment data into your system.

DataSync will create 3 tables in your system, in the schema / dataset / folder / spreadsheet of your choice: [containers](/datasync/table-properties/containers), [shipments](/datasync/table-properties/shipments), and [tracking_requests](/datasync/table-properties/tracking-requests). In addition to these 3 tables, a technical table named [_transfer_status](/datasync/table-properties/transfer-status) is also created, which tells you when each table was last refreshed.

We can send the data to almost any database, data warehouse, or object store, as well as to Google Sheets. See the [full list of supported systems](/datasync/supported-destinations).


## How often does the data update?
DataSync will keep the data tables updated with a refresh every hour.

Each refresh reloads only the rows that have been changed since the previous refresh, so you won't have excess writes to your system.

To check when a table was last updated, check the [_transfer_status](/datasync/table-properties/transfer-status) table - for each row in that table there is a unique table key, and the time when the latest sync occurred for that table.


## How to use the data
You can use the container and shipment tracking data any way you like, but here are a couple ideas:

    - Send data directly to your visualization/analytics/reports software like PowerBI or Tableau
    - Send data directly to your TMS or ERP
    - Join data with one of your own tables
    - Use a Database View or Pivot Table to narrow down what you're looking at, or rename columns
    - Use Database Triggers to respond to updates


## The setup process
For users that are already tracking shipments with Terminal49, the setup is a 3-step process that takes less than 2 hours on average. Some simpler setups are done in 20 minutes. See below for ways to get data into the system.

    1. **Connect data systems**. This could mean doing role-based auth or sharing credentials for a single-purpose user. See our [security FAQ](https://help.terminal49.com/en/articles/7988732-security-considerations-for-terminal49-datasync) if you want to know more about how we keep your data secure.
    
    2. **1-hour configuration call**. We make sure you're getting data the way you want, configuring it to fit in with how you store all your current data.
    
    3. **Start querying the data**. And then you're ready to go! Nothing new to learn - use the tools you already know, now with more data.
