The `tracking_requests` table contains 1 row per tracking request (`tracking_request_id`is the unique key).

A tracking request can fail or succeed (`status` column). A successful tracking request will lead to the creation of a shipment (`shipment_id`).

There can be multiple tracking requests for the same requested number (possibly failing before finally succeeding).
