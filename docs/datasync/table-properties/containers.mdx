_This is a deprecated version of the `containers` table, used by DataSync customers before September 2024._

The `containers` table contains 1 row per container (`container_id` is the unique key).

Each container is part of 1 shipment (`shipment_id`).

This is a large table with denormalized columns to make it easy to use for reporting purposes.
