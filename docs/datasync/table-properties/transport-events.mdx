The `transport_events` table contains 1 row per event (`id`is the unique key).

An event is associated to a specific container (`container_id` is the foreign key).

An event is a specific milestone in the container lifecycle: for example, when the container was loaded at the Port of Lading, or when the vessel arrived at the Port of Discharge.
These events are provided as columns in the `containers` DataSync table, and as rows here in the `transport_events` table. You can use one or the other based on what is most practical for you. The `transport_events` table includes the transshipment events, which are not part of the `containers` table columns.

This table does not provide any estimated future events.

_The `transport_events` table is currently only provided to DataSync customers who request it._

_Rail events from the POD to the inland destination are only provided in the Intermodal Rail product : rail_loaded, rail_departed, rail_arrived, arrived_at_inland_destination, rail_unloaded, pickup_lfd.changed._
