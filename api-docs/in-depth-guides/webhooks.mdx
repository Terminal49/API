## Creating Webhooks
You can subscribe to events through webhooks to be alerted when events are triggered.

Visit https://app.terminal49.com/developers/webhooks and click the 'Create Webhook Endpoint' button to create your webhook through the UI.

If you prefer to create webhooks programmatically, see the [webhooks post endpoint documentation](/api-docs/api-reference/webhooks/create-a-webhook).


## Available Webhook Events

Each `WebhookNotification` event represents a change to a model that may trigger a notification.

## Receiving Webhooks

When an event is triggered, Terminal49 will attempt to POST to the URL you provided with the webhook.

The payload of every webhook is a `WebhookNotification`. Each `WebhookNotification` includes a `reference_object` in its relationships which is the subject of that notification (e.g., a tracking request or an updated container).

Terminal49 expects the endpoint to return one of these HTTP status codes:
- [HTTP 200 OK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)
- [HTTP 201 Created](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201)
- [HTTP 202 Accepted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202)
- [HTTP 204 No Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/204)

To ensure delivery of all webhook notifications, any other response (including timeouts) will result in up to twelve retry attempts.

> [How to Troubleshoot Missing Webhook Notifications](https://help.terminal49.com/en/articles/7851422-missing-webhook-notifications)


## Security
Terminal49 provides two ways to verify webhook authenticity:

1. Verify webhook signatures to confirm events are sent from Terminal49
2. Verify the source IP address against Terminal49's list of webhook IPs

### Webhook Notification Origin IP
Webhook notifications will only come from these IP addresses:

```
35.222.62.171
3.230.67.145
44.217.15.129
```

### Verifying the Webhook Signature (Optional)
When you create or retrieve a webhook, the model includes a `secret` attribute.

For each webhook notification, Terminal49 generates a signature using the webhook `secret` as the key to create an HMAC hex digest with SHA-256 on the body.

This signature is included in the header as `X-T49-Webhook-Signature`.

To verify that a third party has not tampered with the webhook payload, perform the same operation on the response body using the webhook secret and confirm the digests match.

Here's an example implementation in Ruby:
```ruby
class WebhooksController < ApplicationController
  def receive_tracking_request
    secret = ENV.fetch('TRACKING_REQUEST_WEBHOOK_SECRET')
    raise 'InvalidSignature' unless valid_signature?(request, secret)

    # continue processing webhook payload...
  end

  private

  def valid_signature?(request, secret)
    hmac = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest('SHA256', secret, request.body.read)
    request.headers['X-T49-Webhook-Signature'] == hmac
  end
end
```

## Webhook Notification Examples

### container.updated

The `container.updated` event notifies you about changes to container properties at the terminal or changes to which terminal the container is (or will be) located at.

The `changeset` attribute contains a hash of all modified container properties. For each changed property:
- The hash key is the property name
- The array contains two values: the previous value and the new value

For example:
```json
"changeset": {
  "pickup_lfd": [null, "2020-05-20 00:00:00"]
}
```
This shows the pickup last free day changed from not being set (null) to May 20, 2020.

Monitored properties include:
- fees_at_pod_terminal
- holds_at_pod_terminal
- pickup_lfd
- pickup_appointment_at
- available_for_pickup
- pod_terminal

The `container_updated.timestamp` attribute indicates when Terminal49 detected the changes at the terminal.

When container availability status changes at the POD Terminal, you'll receive `container.updated` events with the `available_for_pickup` key in the `changeset`.
