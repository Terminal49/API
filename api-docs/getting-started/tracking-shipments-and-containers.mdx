## What is a Tracking Request?
A tracking request requires two pieces of data:

    - A Bill of Lading, booking number, or container number from the carrier
    - The SCAC code for that carrier

You can see a complete list of supported SCAC codes in row 2 of the Carrier Data Matrix.

## What sort of numbers can I track?

**Supported numbers**

    1. Master Bill of Lading from the carrier (recommended)
    2. Booking number from the carrier
    3. Container number

* Container number tracking support varies across ocean carriers. Please refer to the Carrier Data Matrix to see which SCAC codes are compatible with container number tracking.

**Unsupported numbers**

    - House Bill of Lading numbers (HBOL)
    - Customs entry numbers
    - Seal numbers
    - Internally generated numbers (e.g., PO numbers or customer reference numbers)

## How do I use Tracking Requests?
Terminal49 provides an event-based API that operates asynchronously. Here's how the data flow works:

    1. You send a tracking request to the API with your Bill of Lading number and SCAC code.
    2. The API acknowledges receipt of your tracking request and returns any immediately available shipment data.
    3. Terminal49 automatically begins tracking the shipment and all associated containers.
    4. You receive updates for any changes or new information via webhook notifications. Updates typically occur when:
       - Containers reach milestones
       - ETA changes (can happen at any time)
       - Terminal availability data becomes available
       - Last Free Day information is updated
    5. You can request current status information at any time by querying the list of shipments and containers from Terminal49. This process is covered in a different guide.

## How do you receive tracking request data?
You have two options:

1. **Poll for updates**: Query the `GET /tracking_request/{id}` endpoint to check your request's status. You'll need to keep track of the request ID returned by the API.

2. **Use webhooks** (recommended): Register a webhook to receive automatic updates. While this requires initial setup, it's more efficient than polling.

A webhook is a web-based callback URL (HTTP Push API) that allows Terminal49 to send notifications to your service. When we successfully locate the Bill of Lading with the carrier's SCAC code, we:
- Create a shipment
- Send a `tracking_request.succeeded` event to your webhook endpoint with the associated record

If we encounter any issues, we send a `tracking_request.failed` event.

## Authentication
Terminal49's API uses Bearer Token authentication. Send your API key as a token with every request.

To get your API token, visit your [Terminal49 account API settings](https://app.terminal49.com/settings/api).

Include the token in each API request's Authentication header:

Support: [dev@terminal49.com](dev@terminal49.com)

```
Authorization: Token YOUR_API_KEY
```

## How to Create a Tracking Request

Here's a JavaScript example of sending a tracking request:
```javascript
fetch("https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests", {
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "content-type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": {
    "data": {
      "attributes": {
        "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
        "request_number": "",
        "scac": ""
      },
      "type": "tracking_request"
    }
  }
})
.then(response => {
  console.log(response);
})
.catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
});
```

## Anatomy of a Tracking Request Response

Here's an example response to a tracking request:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "478cd7c4-a603-4bdf-84d5-3341c37c43a3",
        "type": "tracking_request",
        "attributes": {
            "request_number": "xxxxxx",
            "request_type": "bill_of_lading",
            "scac": "MAEU",
            "ref_numbers": [],
            "created_at": "2020-09-17T16:13:30Z",
            "status": "pending",
            "failed_reason": null,
            "is_retrying": false,
            "retry_count": null
        },
        "relationships": {
            "tracked_object": {
                "data": null
            }
        },
        "links": {
            "self": "/v2/tracking_requests/478cd7c4-a603-4bdf-84d5-3341c37c43a3"
        }
    }
}
```

If you attempt to track a shipment that's already being tracked, you'll receive this error:
```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "status": "422",
            "source": {
                "pointer": "/data/attributes/request_number"
            },
            "title": "Unprocessable Entity",
            "detail": "Request number 'xxxxxxx' with scac 'MAEU' already exists in a tracking_request with a pending or created status",
            "code": "duplicate"
        }
    ]
}
```

<Info>
**Why so much JSON? (A note on JSON:API)**

The Terminal49 API is JSON:API compliant, enabling libraries to translate JSON into a fully-fledged object model for ORM use. While this requires a larger, more structured payload, it provides powerful functionality. For direct JSON parsing, this might seem less convenient. We recommend using a JSON:API library to maximize the API's capabilities, but we'll work with direct JSON for these introductory examples.

## Try It: Make a Tracking Request
Use the request maker below to try creating a tracking request:

1. Enter your API token in the authorization header value
2. Provide values for `request_number` and `scac`:
   - The request number must be a shipping line booking or master bill of lading number
   - The SCAC must be a valid shipping line SCAC code (see data sources for valid codes)

You can access sample code in multiple languages by clicking "Code Generation" below.

<Warning>
**Tracking Request Troubleshooting**

The most common issue is using incorrect tracking numbers.

Verify that you're using the Bill of Lading number, booking number, or container number - not an internal reference number from your company or freight forwarder. Test the number on the carrier's website first. If it works there and the SCAC is supported by Terminal49, you should be able to track it with us.

Sometimes issues arise from the shipping line's side due to temporary network problems or unpopulated manifests. We handle these situations as described in the [Tracking Request Retrying](/api-docs/useful-info/tracking-request-retrying) section.

```json
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": "{\r\n  \"data\": {\r\n    \"attributes\": {\r\n      \"request_type\": \"bill_of_lading\",\r\n      \"request_number\": \"\",\r\n      \"scac\": \"\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"type\": \"tracking_request\"\r\n  }\r\n}"
}
```

## Try It: List Your Active Tracking Requests
Since we haven't set up webhooks yet, we'll need to manually poll to check tracking request status.

**Try it below. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key in the headers.**

```json
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://api.terminal49.com/v2/tracking_requests",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/vnd.api+json",
    "Authorization": "Token YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```
