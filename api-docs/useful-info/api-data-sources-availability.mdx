# Data Sources

- **Ocean Carriers (aka Steamship Lines):** Bill of lading/booking details, vessel ETA, containers and milestones
- **Container Terminal Operators:** Container availability, last free day, holds, fees etc.
- **Container Rail Carriers:** Container milestones via rail
- **AIS Data:** Vessel details and real-time location tracking (coming soon!)

# Data Fields & Availability

Below is a list of data that can be retrieved via the API, including whether it is always available, or whether it is only supported by certain carriers (Carrier Dependent), certain Terminals (Terminal Dependent) or on certain types of journeys (Journey Dependent).

## Shipment Data
Shipment Data is the primary data that comes from the Carrier. It contains the details of the shipment retrieved from the Bill of Lading and references multiple container objects.
